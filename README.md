# Hi, I'm Tuxified Gaming! 👋

## 💻 Aspiring Full-Stack Developer & Gamer

I am a single-player focused gamer currently learning to code. I’m transitioning from no-code tools to building utility applications from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🚀 Current Project: Mech Arena AT

I'm building a **Mech Arena Achievement Tracker** to help players visualize and track their progress through all 44 Mechs in the game.
• Status: Data collection phase.
• Tech Stack: Learning HTML/CSS for the frontend.
• Goal: Create a clean utility tool for the Mech Arena community.

## 🎮 Gaming Interests
• Mech Arena
• Geometry Dash
• Minecraft (MCBE)
